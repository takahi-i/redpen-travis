# Distributed system
Some software tools work in more than one machine. Such distributed (cluster) systems can handle huge data or tasks, because such software tools utilize large amount of computer resources.
In this article, we call a computer server that works as a member of a cluster an "instance." For example, each instance in distributed search engines stores the fractions of data.
Such distributed systems need a component to merge the preliminary results from member instances.
